# mfutils

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The mfutils package is a collection of various R functions that I frequently use.
Most of these functions I have created myself, however some I have found on stackexchange (and included the attribution/url in the documentation).

These functions can be sorted into different categories:

- __general__ utilities for constructing and manipulating base R objects, such as character vectors and lists
- common __matrix__ operations
- __plotting__ (mostly ggplot2 enhancements)
- tools for implementing __representational similarity analysis (RSA)__, including spatial prewhitening and various distance measures
- convenience functions for working with __gifti__ objects from the `gifti` package (for surface fMRI data)

Although these categories are pretty different, I currently prefer to have these functions all within a single package (e.g., rather than a separate package for RSA), just to keep things simple.


## Installation

You can install the released version of mfutils from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("mfutils")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mcfreund/mfutils")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(mfutils)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
